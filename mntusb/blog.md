# I didn't buy a reform for it to be replaced
I didn't buy my reform for it to be replaced in a few years by other reforms, or god forbid a framework. I bought it to be my computer. *The* computer. So when it wasn't, I set about to fix that, not reach for another clamshell.
## How do I fix it?
Well, this is where things fly off the rails (immediately).
I love open hardware in concept and practice, but I also don't want to sacrifice my actual daily activities in the name of using "pure" hardware. So, what are the main problems that open source hardware is solving for me?

Problems with closed source hardware:
Drivers
Crap firmware
Antifeatures
Can't modify
Can't extend
Isn't built to specific needs
Trust

Some, but not all, of these problems are reasonably mitigated on the Steamdeck:
It's first party linux, so drivers for what I'm running are real good.
Firmware is real good, and editable
Contains no antifeatures to my knowledge (please correct me if you know otherwise)
Exists as a chip on a board with just a usb-c, video adapter, and NVMe-- This doesn't make it modifiable or extendable, but it does shift the problem in a manner that I personally will accept as a tradeoff. The reform already has lots of segmentation internally, which is great! If I want to do something with the board, I will use usb-c. Challenge accepted.
It isn't built to my needs, but being built for first party linux gaming makes it a close enough superset of design targets that most of the development, graphics, and gaming stuff I want to do should be reasonably possible!
Finally, I don't trust any hardware as a rule.

## MVP
Now, let's temporarily shelve all the benefits we identified in the name of an MVP.
